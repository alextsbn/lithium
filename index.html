            <h1>lithium properties</h1>
            <p class="main-text">Lithium has a melting point of 180.54 C, a boiling point of 1342 C, a specific gravity
                of 0.534 (20 C), and a valence of 1. It is the lightest of the metals, with a density approximately half
                that of water. Under ordinary conditions, lithium is the least dense of the solid elements. It has the
                highest specific heat of any solid element. Metallic lithium is silvery in appearance. It reacts with
                water, but not as vigorously as does sodium. Lithium imparts a crimson color to flame, although the
                metal itself burns a bright white. Lithium is corrosive and requires special handling. Elemental lithium
                is extremely flammable.</p>

                <p>Lithium is an alkaline metal with the atomic number three. It is the lightest metal on Earth, as well
                    as the least dense solid element. Lithium is a rare metal in the Earth’s crust and never occurs
                    freely in nature. Its main sources are the minerals lepidolite, petalite, amblygonite, zinnwaldite
                    and spodumene. Lithium is commercialised as a concentrated mineral in various chemical compounds
                    (particularly in the form of carbonate or hydroxide). Lithium applications are increasingly diverse:
                    it is used in ceramic and glass production, metallurgy of aluminium, manufacture of synthetic rubber
                    and of lubricants, the process of purification of air in confined environments, in batteries as
                    lithium bromide, and as lithium carbonate it is used in the pharmaceutical industry for the
                    treatment of depression. With the increase in demand, and the consequent rise in the price of
                    lithium, especially of the compounds used in the manufacture of lithium batteries, lithium carbonate
                    and lithium hydroxide, pegmatite deposits are becoming cost-effective sources of lithium. After
                    having secured the best pegmatite deposits in their countries, Australian and Canadian prospecting
                    and research companies (P&R) began the study of other deposits of lithiniferous pegmatites occurring
                    in Europe and particularly in Portugal, which is one of their P&R bases. The year 2016 was a year of
                    excellence in the emergence of numerous ‘young companies’ around the world that together with
                    traditional industrial companies operated not only from hard rock, but also from lithium exploration
                    of salar brines. In 2017 Portugal ranked in sixth place worldwide and first in Europe in the mining
                    production of lithium (USGS, 2018).</p>
